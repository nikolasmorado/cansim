// holding off on implementing this.
// could just do based on rpm to simululate the alternator charging
// the battery with more revs, but ill wait to have other things in
// place to properly simulate a drain on the battery.
//
// may be the last sensor, or may make a simplified one and then add to it,
// who knows.
