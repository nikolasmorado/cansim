# CANSIM
im putting a stroker 4.0 (4.6) in my jk
may as well write my own ecu too

## ASSUMPTIONS
have to make some in order to get anything done:
- 5500 redline, same as the current 3.8 in case i finish ahead of schedule
- voltage based sensors are ratiometric allowing the bottom and top 10% for error monitoring
- 100 kpa atmospheric pressure (im not a physics guy idk if this is a huge sin, ill fix it eventually)

subject to change, will likely be roughly equivalent to "you have the same exact car as me" before i optimize anything

### about the project
premature optimization is the root of all evil, ill make it good later.

not too sure where i want to take this repo yet.
i know for sure i want this to be able to simulate an automotive can bus
so that i can debug without wasting money.

not sure if ill have that happen with a daemon or if ill just keep it all
in the project or what. 

this may end up being the repo for the ecu and the simulator is a module

who knows.

if youre seeing this readme either you went back in the edit history

or you like to look at obscure overambitious projects
