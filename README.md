# CANSIM
im putting a stroker 4.0 (4.6) in my jk
may as well write my own ecu too

### about the project
premature optimization is the root of all evil, ill make it good later.

not too sure where i want to take this repo yet.
i know for sure i want this to be able to simulate an automotive can bus
so that i can debug without wasting money.

not sure if ill have that happen with a daemon or if ill just keep it all
in the project or what. 

this may end up being the repo for the ecu and the simulator is a module

who knows.

if youre seeing this readme either you went back in the edit history

or you like to look at obscure overambitious projects
